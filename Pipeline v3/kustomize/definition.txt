Kustomzie features:
1. define high some high level roles to be appplied for all the steps - also implementd in gitlab

steps:
    step1:
      title: step1
      commands:
        echo "hello world"
    step2:
      title: step2
      commands:
        echo "hello world"

----------------------------
- image:alpine
----------------------------
step1:
  title: step1
  image: alpine
  commands:
    echo "hello world"
step2:
  title: step2
  image: alpine
  commands:
    echo "hello world"

2. auto generator  - ( i dont think it will be fit for out use case)
kustomize provide some generators for different resources types. such as config map, services, deployments etc.
in our use case we have basiclly one type - codefresh.yaml which represent the workflow itself

3. base yaml
kustomize support in base terminology
----
bases:
 ${{path to the base yaml file}}
 1. ../base.yaml
 2. https://github.com/codefresh-io/workflow-examples/base.yaml?ref=v1.0.0

we can patch the base yaml by specify

example:

base.yaml:

version: 1.0
steps:
    step1:
      title: step1
      image: alpine
      commands:
        echo "hello world"
    step2:
      title: step2
      image: alpine
      commands:
        echo "hello world2"
--------------------------------------------
patch.yaml:

base:
 ../base.yaml
step2:
  title: patch-step-2

--------------------------------------------
result:

version: 1.0
steps:
    step1:
      title: step1
      image: alpine
      commands:
        echo "hello world"
    step2:
      title: patch-step-2
      image: alpine
      commands:
        echo "hello world2"


#####
IMPORTANT:
the concept in kustomize its a bit different from what we had in out mind.
all the chnages to be applied specified in kustomize.yaml file:

kustomize.yaml:

bases:
- ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
- localserv.yaml


and to get the final yaml they applied => kustomize build $DEV_HOME

in my opinion we should do the same, but we will "Run" the kustomize behind the scene
more over i dont see any justification for using patchesStrategic concept. we can do it by conventions without to specify it directly
